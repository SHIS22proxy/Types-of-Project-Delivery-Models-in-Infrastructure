Types of Project Delivery Models in Infrastructure
1. Introduction
Infrastructure development is foundational to economic growth and national development. To build roads, bridges, power plants, airports, and water systems, governments and private entities use various project delivery models that define how projects are financed, constructed, and operated.

Choosing the right model is critical to ensuring timely completion, budget efficiency, risk management, and quality assurance. This guide explores the most commonly used infrastructure project delivery models, comparing their structure, risk allocation, and best-use scenarios.

This guide is intended for:

Civil and infrastructure engineers

Government agencies and policymakers

Private sector investors and developers

Students and researchers in infrastructure planning

Project managers and consultants

2. Key Terminology
Project Delivery Model: A contractual arrangement defining responsibilities between parties in delivering an infrastructure asset.

Public-Private Partnership (PPP): Collaboration between public and private sectors to finance and operate a project.

EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction): Contractor handles all design, procurement, and construction tasks.

BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer): Private entity builds, operates, and transfers the asset to the public authority after a period.

DBFOT (Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer): A PPP variation where the private party designs, builds, finances, and operates the asset.

BOOT (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer): Private entity owns and operates the asset during the concession period.

HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model): Government pays a fixed portion upfront and the remainder through annuity payments.

3. Technical Overview
Major Types of Project Delivery Models
Model	Description	Financing	Risk Sharing
EPC	Government-funded model where contractor delivers a fully-built asset.	100% by government	Low private risk
PPP	General term for public-private collaborations. Includes BOT, DBFOT, etc.	Shared	Balanced
BOT (Toll/Annuity)	Private entity builds, operates, and recovers investment via tolls or annuity.	Private	Revenue risk with private
DBFOT	Private party handles design to operations with return via tolls or annuity.	Private + VGF	High private risk
BOOT	Private entity owns the asset temporarily.	Private	High private risk
HAM	40% paid during construction; 60% via government annuities over time.	Shared	Revenue risk with government

4. Step-by-Step Guide or Workflow
How to Choose a Delivery Model
Assess Project Size & Scope

Small government-funded projects → EPC

Large national highways → PPP, BOT, HAM

Evaluate Revenue Potential

Can tolls sustain the project?

Use BOT (Toll) if yes, BOT (Annuity) if no

Determine Risk Appetite

High risk → Private prefers HAM or EPC

Government can retain risk with VGF

Select Model Based on Project Features

Project Type	Suggested Model
Highway with high traffic	BOT (Toll)
Rural road with low toll potential	HAM
Water treatment plant	BOOT
Metro systems	EPC or DBFOT

5. Best Practices
Conduct proper feasibility studies before selecting a delivery model.

Align incentives: Balance between public goals and private ROI.

Ensure transparent bidding processes.

Include robust dispute resolution mechanisms in contracts.

Perform regular audits and performance monitoring.

6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Issue	Description	Solution
Poor risk allocation	Private party bears too much risk	Redesign contract structure
Delays in approvals	Bureaucratic delays slow project execution	Streamline single-window clearances
Financing hurdles	Private party unable to raise funds	Government offers guarantees or VGF
Toll collection issues	Low usage or evasion reduces revenue	Use electronic tolling and enforcement
